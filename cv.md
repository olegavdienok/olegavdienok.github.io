## About me

My goal is to get a job in IT. I have some experience in web development.

1. Passed courses from the Senla company
2. Independently studied web development on the resources of [Stepik](https://stepik.org) and [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
3. Made 2 full-fledged projects
4. I work as a web development teacher at the IT-STEP company and at the same time I teach software testing

I never stop learning. I love passing on my knowledge to others. I want to teach everyone how to make cool things with their own hands.
